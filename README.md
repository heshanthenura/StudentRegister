## 1. Overview

### In this article, I'll share my experience of building the same web app using two different frameworks, Angular and React. I'll provide a detailed comparison of my development journey with each framework, highlighting the pros and cons of both, to help you make an informed choice for your future web development projects

## 2.Project Generation

### I crafted the Angular web app using Angular CLI version 16.2.5, and for the React project, I opted for Yarn due to issues encountered during the initial project creation with npm. Both projects are built using TypeScript, offering a robust and statically typed foundation for web development
